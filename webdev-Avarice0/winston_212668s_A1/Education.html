           was the primary school I attended for 6 years. Filled with playful classmates and
          patient teachers, I learnt alot about the world, math, science, social studies and languages.
          Despite it being a small neighbourhood school, I am proud to have come this far and owe alot of my
          foundations to Admiralty Primary School.

          was where I had the most memories of. Practical sessions teaching the fundamentals
          of a subject, lecture based curriculum were all part of my education there.
          It allowed me to be accustomed to tertiary education at NYP. It was also where I first garnered an interest
          for coding! Python was an examinable subject and I participated in the third batch of O'Level candidates.
          My computing lecturer was an experienced coder that taught us everything we needed to know about python,
          well... not everything but it was enough for me to get amazing grades!

          Where am I now? Right, I am at <a href="https://www.nyp.edu.sg/schools/sdm.html" target="_blank">Nanyang Polytechnic's School of Design & Media</a>. Here, I am furthering myself
          to be a game developer. I may not be the best, but I put in 100% of effort and strive to be at my best
          performance everyday.
          It may be hard at times, confusing, or even outright demanding, but I refuse to give up until I can make a
          game that I'm proud of.
