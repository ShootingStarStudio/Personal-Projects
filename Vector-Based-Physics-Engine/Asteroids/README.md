Controls:
WASD to move the ship
SPACE to fire the gun
SHIFT(while pressing W) to spend fuel for afterburn speed boost
TAB to use special, default is shotgun, other implementations may be given
QE to cycle through the list of ammunition
such as shotgun, railgun and barrier
shotgun deals damage in an arc
railgun doesnt despawn until it exits the map, dealing 10 damage while piercing through enemies
barrier is a bouncy shield that spawns from the player, pushing all enemies away

the main weapon is a broken machine gun(intentional) 
which has terrible accuracy and overheats every 20 shots. cools down and reloads within 2s

this is to paint the picture of a broken space ship fighting for his life against the space swarm. 

enemies are included in 4 types
scouts which stays at range while attacking the player
bomber which is a suicide bomber that homes in to the ship. 
its size is bigger, while speed and agility is lower to enable the player to hit them easier.
Hive which is the first stage of the boss, having no movement while being at 50hp. 
it spawns scouts and bombers periodically.
Queen, after breaking the hive, alot of scouts will escape the hive, protecting the queen, 
which also spawns alot more enemies, while evading the player. 

cosmic events also occur frequently. 
from blackholes to asteroids, but both can be useful. 
such as the ORE asteroid, which drops valuable resources, such as 
fuel, ammunition and health.
or the black hole, sucking in enemies and destroying those that get too close.
the white hole which pushes enemies away. 

there is a wave manager that ticks every 15s, spawning increasingly difficult waves. 
bosses will be introduced in wave 5 while enemies grow more and more numerous.
