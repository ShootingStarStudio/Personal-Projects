- 👋 Hi, I’m winston.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning concepts and programming in general
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ as a novice first language
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating games and software development
- 📫 How to reach me?: via this account

i wish to learn more about the world and its natural formations, hoping to apply world generation in computers.
as such, find out how to optimize such large world generations and make the games with immersive worlds.

i am also interested to create animals and plants naturally and create an artificial ecosystem.
i am currently researching emergent behavior and how creatures interact with each other on a global scale.
