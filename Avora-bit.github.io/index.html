            Everytime someone hums a tune or taps their finger in a beat, they are produing music, their own kind of
            music. Pick up and play an instrument and you too shall find the joys of making music! But first, a small

                                Instruments</a> are instruments made to produce tones by vibrating the air. Used in

                            entertainment. There are 4 main branches of musical instruments: String, Percussion,

                                            will vibrate the air around the strings, leading into a hollow within the

                                            is a family of classical music instrument. It is played by blowing into its

                                            tones. It does not have a reed and thus is considered easier to learn.
                                            Nearly every major country has its own version of the flute, most likely due
                                            to how easy it is to make.

                                    called:"Sympathetic vibration of air in a tubular resonator". A variety of slides,

                                    harmonics of the instrument. Skilled players are able to forgo most steps, and rely
                                    on lip tension and air flow to select specific tones with the same settings.

                                            except for the larger size and complexity of the components, resulting in a
                                            richer and more dynamic sound, albeit requiring more skill.

                                                target="_blank">trumpet</a> was historically used as signalling devices
                                            during battle or hunts, being able to signal 3 keys and thus 7 unique tones
                                            over long distances. Playing the trumpet involves blowing into the
                                            mouthpiece and then pressing keys. It has been popularized in orchestras,
                                            bands and the jazz and pop genres.
