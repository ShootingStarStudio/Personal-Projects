/*
	Fourier is a french mathematician that theorised that: 
	Any function of a variable, whether continuous or discontinuous, can be expanded in a seies of sines of multipes of the variable.
	The rebuilding of the function is known as fourier synthesis. 
	Both operations are known as the study of fourier analysis. 

	Fourier transform: decomposes functions into frequency components, which has an output of the transform as a function of frequency. 
	Fourier synthesis: rebuilds the function using samples of the pieces. 
	Fourier series: a periodic funciton as a sum of sine and cosine waves. 
	The frequency of each wave is an integer multiple of the periodic function's fundamental frequency. 
	Types of Oscillations:
		Sine, Triangle, Sawtooth, Pulse(square)
